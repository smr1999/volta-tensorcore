# Volta Tensorcore  

**In this repository implements article "Modeling Deep Learning Accelerator Enabled GPUs, ISPASS 2019" with python**

**Some features of this simulator are:**
- Based on FP16 execution mode of Volta
- Cycle accurate
- Models a simple SM with tensorcore and registerfiles
- Also it can execute each size of matrix

**To run the code:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
